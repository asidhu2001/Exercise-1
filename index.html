    </div>   
    <p> Hi, my name is Amritpaul Sidhu. I am actually a 5th year student. I should've
        graduated last semester but i got held back because i forgot to take the EPP exam. 
        That being said, I have now passed the exam and i quite literally dont need to worry about 
        passing any classes because I am already guaranteed to graduate this semester. A little bit
        about myself, i like to play video games, lift weights and be lazy. My favorite show is an anime
        called DragonBall Z and it was my childhood. It's also the reason i started to workout. Some of my
        favorite music genres include hip-hop/rap and phonk. Something that interests me is definitely
        being a streamer/content creator, I always thought that life was spectacular and would've 
        loved to pursue it when i was younger, i've since given up on becoming that but i wont lie,
        i still do have the thoughts of trying to become one on the side.
    </p>
